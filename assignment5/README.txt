I am submitting Dijkstra.java, Display.java, Edge.java, Vertex.java and written.pdf, and also citypairs.txt, cityxy.txt


I only edited Dijkstra.java, and it solves the programming portion.
To run, keep citypairs.txt, cityxy.txt in the same folder but outside the src folder, and compile all .java files, and then run Display.java
