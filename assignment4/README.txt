written.txt includes written questions of the assignment.


SpellChecker.java class that answers Programming Q 1.  To run, make sure words.txt and filetospellcheck.txt are in the same folder that you are running it on, outside of the src folder.  As asked in the question, when running the class you are asked for two command line arguments which are the dictionary (you type words.txt) and the personal dictionary you are spell checking (you type filetospellcheck.txt). 


words.txt given, keep out of src folder.


filetospellcheck.txt I added words that test specific functions.  Abby should test that there are no suggestions because that word is in the dictionary.  Abb should test that you can add a letter to make Abby.  Abbyx should test that you can take away a letter to get Abby.  Abyb should test that you can switch letters to get baby and abby.  Bby should also test for adding a letter in the beginning to get Abby.  (may be other suggestions included but I was just checking the addOne removeOne and exchange methods.


KBestCounter.java to run just compile the and run TestKBest.java.  Only issue is it is not printing in the same order that the tester says but the order was not specified in the problem so I just left it.


TestKBest.java given.
